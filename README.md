# Highest frequency in a given list of numbers.

I show how to implement my own Heap and BST with tree data structures. This is ALL my own code, without any help from the internet; especially difficult is figuring out how to updateEnd() in the heap, but this work represents my ability to overcome my own challenges.

I could just use libraries for this, but this is to showcase my algorithm-solving skills as well as my capabilities as a programmer.
